# AI Assistant Rules

Define the rules and guidelines for how the AI assistant should operate in this project.

## Code Style
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions
- Avoid comments and docstrings (Important!)
- Avoid using try-except if it only contains logging, prefer fail fast approach

## Temporary code rules
- If you are generating something you were not explicitly asked to, it's a stub
- Keep stubs as short as possible

## Testing Requirements
- Write tests before implementation
- Run all tests in virtual environment
- Keep tests clean and up-to-date
- Tests must be in the test/ directory

## Development Workflow
1. Planning Phase:
   - Plan code structure before implementation
   - Consider integration with existing codebase
   - Plan for error cases and edge conditions

2. Implementation Phase:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement solution
   - Run tests until passing
   - Remove any debug code

3. Review Phase:
   - Ensure code follows all style guidelines
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Check documentation completeness
   - Confirm no debug code remains

## Dependencies Management
- Compare new dependencies with requirements.txt
- Pass dependencies through class initialization
- Update requirements.txt when adding dependencies

## Communication
- Be concise and direct
- Don't compliment my ideas
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear

## File Organization
- Keep related files together
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Maintain consistent directory structure
- Separate concerns into different modules

## Security
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Performance
- Optimize database queries
- Use appropriate data structures
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Monitor and profile performance bottlenecks
